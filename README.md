# desmond-gist
Implementation of grid inhomogeneous solvation theory in python.
GIST provides spatially resolved contribution to free energy of solvation (with breakdowon of entropy and enthalpy) in systems of biomolecular and pharmaceutical interest. This version of GIST contains additional features that provide information on local structue of water in protein active sites, which can be valuable for ligand design.

This program requires a working Desmond/Maestro installation and is intended mainly for Desmond generated trajectories. 
More details on how to install and use this program and a tutorial will be posted soon.
